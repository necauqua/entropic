This is a cool idea I once had of making simple full-terminal pixel editor
with halfblocks and mouse input support.

It kind of works, and I explored a lot of Rust stuff while making it, but it is
yet another one of my projects that got completely abandoned.

## Building
Well, `cargo build` to build it, `cargo run` to just run it, simple Rust.
